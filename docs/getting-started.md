Getting started
===============

A good staring point to get into Mara is to install the [Mara Example Project 1](https://github.com/mara/mara-example-project-1) locally, run it and investigate how the data pipelines are designed.

Take a look here where Dr. Martin Loetzsch explains the ETL Patters typically used in Mara with PostgreSQL databases:
